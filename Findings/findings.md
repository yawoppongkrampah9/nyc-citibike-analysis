## Total Rides by Usertype


| Usertype  | Total Rides | Average Duration (minutes) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Subscriber | 46,915,311  | 13.44                     |
| Customer   | 6,190,825   | 35.76                     |


The majority of Citi Bike riders are Subscribers, accounting for about 88% of all trips. However, Customers tend to take longer rides, averaging more than double the duration of Subscribers. This suggests casual users may use bikes for leisure or tourism, while Subscribers likely use them for commuting. (Refer to the usertype breakdown chart.)



## Distribution of Citi Bike Rides Across Hours of the Day

Most Citi Bike trips occur between 7 AM and 8 PM, with clear peaks at 8 AM, 5 PM, and 6 PM. These peak hours align with typical commute times, indicating high usage during the start and end of the workday. (See hourly usage bar chart.)


## Usertype Ride Patterns by Day of the Week

Subscribers consistently dominate bike usage throughout the week with peaks from Tuesdays to Thursdays. In contrast, customers(casual riders) account for minimal volume, with particularly higher activity on Saturday and Sundays, suggesting more recreational use. This pattern provides an opportunity to incentivize casual riders with weekdays  benefits to convert them to subscribers.



## Total Rides by Daytype

Weekday rides accounted for nearly 76% of total bike usage, reinforcing the dominance of commuting patterns observed in the day-of-week breakdown. (Referenced in the weekday vs. weekend comparison chart.)


## Trip Volumes By Season

Bike usage peaks during summer, indicating summer being the most dominant recreational season. Fall and spring follow with relatively high bike rides. However, winters accounted for less than half of each of the other seasons, likely due to colder weather and less favorable riding conditions. This seasonal trend suggests a strong correlation between weather and bike ridership behavior. (See seasonal trend bar chart.)

The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between station capacity and total trips. Larger stations tend to serve more rides, although the relationship is not perfectly linear. The trend line helps visualize this association clearly. (Refer to scatter plot of capacity vs. trip volume.)



## RECOMMENDATIONS

Offer discounts to casual riders taking longer trips to encourage subscription.

Restock bike stations more frequently during summer months.

Allocate more bikes to high-capacity stations.

Adjust staffing schedules to align with peak usage hours (8 AMâ€“5 PM).

Expand capacity at top-performing stations to meet high demand.
